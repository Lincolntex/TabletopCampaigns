## Intro:

300 years ago, the Cataclysm Brought ruin to Krynn. In one day, the Age of Wonders came to an end; reshaping the face of the world, taking countless innocent lives and the power of the gods with them. Through tremendous struggle in the centuries since, the world of Krynn survived, but would remain forever changed. The remaining nations that did survive the Cataclysm are meager shades of the superpowers they used to be, and have only just begun to claw back the world from the clutches of darkness and rediscover their new harsher world.

## History:

Due to the Cataclysm, the history of Krynn is fractured and incomplete. The public care little for stories of the past as most of them are just trying to survive in the slowly healing, scarred lands. While broken and disjointed, the remaining sages of the world focused on collecting and archiving the fragments of the past focus on three periods of time; Pre-Cataclysm (PC), the Cataclysm itself, and the dire age since known as After Cataclysm (AC ). 
#### Pre-cataclysm:

This was the time of Success and triumph for Krynn. Many cultures and institutions came into being during this time, like the Knights of Solamnia and the Mages of High Sorcery. This was the time of myth and legend. When Huma Dragonbane used the first of the fabled Dragonlances to defeat the evil dragon god Takhisis the Dragon Queen forcing her and her army to leave the mortal world. 

The 1000 years before the Cataclysm is known as the Age of Might. During this time, several human civilizations had flourished, but none more than the Nation of Istar due in part to their military alliance with the Knights of Solamnia. Over the centuries, the Nation of Istar was lead by a series of kingpriests who declared Istar the center of the world and considered themselves the holy messengers of the Gods of Good. As beliefs of this nature often do, this idea corrupted the Kingpriests and population of Istar, finally culminating in the last Kingpriest of Istar to preform a magical ritual to attain Divinity and rule Istar in the name of good for the rest of time. This finally spurred the Gods into action, united in their condemnation of Istar.

#### Cataclysm:

The gods did not approve of Istars actions and sent 13 warnings to try and convince the rulers of Istar to cease their grasp at godhood. Trees wept blood, unnatural storms and fires raged uncontrollably, and cyclones struck the Kingpriests temple. They also sent a few mortal chosen to try and convince Istar to stop their blasphemous ways as well, reasoning that if they were successful, the world was not beyond saving. Alas, all their messengers failed (one of them Lord Loden Soth) as the Kingpriests of Istar dismissed their warnings.  Unbeknownst to Istar, servants of the evil God Tikahisis interfered with several crystals used in the ritual to open a rift to the Divine realm, with the goal to send the rift to the Dragon Gods prison in the abyss. At the final hour of the Istar Assentation ritual, the gods whisked away their most devout and unleashed hell on all those who remained. 

The rift collapsed, which would have devastated Istar on its own, but the dark corruption of the Dragon Queen amplified the tremendous and terrible effects tenfold. A mountain of Dark Enegry and Fire fell from the sky, reshaping the land and leaving a massive storm ravaged sea where the Istar nation once stood, known now as the Blood Sea of Istar. Coastlines throughout the world shifted, sundering nations, drowning entire regions, stranding ports miles from any ocean, and culling the population of the world by over half. Though some lands were hit harder than others, none were spared from the divine wrath. The gods and their blessings then faded from the world, and in time, even their names faded into distant myth and legends of the past. 

#### After-Cataclysm:

This disaster ushed in a period of chaos known as the Time of Darkness. Organizations like the Knights of Solamnia who could have been able to preserve unity in Ansalon were now seen as traitors due to their alliance with Istar and were distrusted. This sowed distrust between nations and radically altered the cultures and ecology of the world. Famine, plague and mass migrations followed. The elven nations closed their borders, and the dwarves withdrew deep into their tunnels, refusing entrance to even other surface dwelling dwarves. Many neighboring cities turned on each other or fell to war or disease. Large warbands of Orcs and Hobgoblins spread, taking advantage of civilizations decline, and gaining control of entire regions. 

While elves and dwarves remained reclusive, in time, the other cultures of Krynn begin to rebuild. Explorers re-mapped the new world, and societies began to reestablish trade routes. As this new civilization arose, they all began to discover the jarring reality of their new world; the gods and their magic were truly gone. Religion was forever altered. True clerics and priests who were able to channel the divine power of the gods had vanished. While some remained devout, most turned to false religions ran by corrupt charlatans in search of answers and comfort. Some of these false leaders claimed to serve in the name of the old gods, some renounced them all together. The widespread misinformation caused by the corruption of these institutions caused the truth to become muddled and subject to conjecture for even the most dedicated scholars.
