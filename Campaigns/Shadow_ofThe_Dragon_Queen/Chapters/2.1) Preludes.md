![[Road_to_vogler_morn.jpg]]
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Narrate</span>:
Characters have set out on their trip to Vogler following the instructions in the letter they received from Becklin, but if they want to be a member of the Mages of High Sorcery, they will first need to complete the Trial of the Barb.

	- Every year and a half, the 3 moons of Krynn align
	- When the moons align, magic energy is more readily available, and easier to tap into. 
- The Barb

		- Built by the Mages of High Sorcery (MHS) before the cataclysm 
	- Original purpose has been lost to time, 
		- serves as a testing grounds for promising young apprentice mages who desire to be part of the MHS.
	- Typically a dead ruin, but comes alive during the Night of the Eye

On a separate road to Vogler, Players are traveling with a small group on their way to Vogler, and have made camp for the night. The characters have found themselves both experiencing a similar reoccurring dream or vision every night since receiving Becklins letter. 

Small group:
- Players
- 1 [Commoner](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/5194951-commoner) 
- 1 [Priest](https://www.dndbeyond.com/monsters/16985-priest)

	- Each player will hear their own god whispering in their ear

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Read</span>:
"You stand at the center of a forest clearing. Clashing steel echoes from the thicket beyond. As you look around you in panic, you realize piles of bodies cover the ground. One of the fallen clutches something against their chest. You're not sure what it is. You reach for it and begin to hear screams and the roars of unknown beasts rising up above the sound of war around you. Just before you can grab the object, it glows briefly, then flashes with intense light."

- Players wake up
- Camp is Ransacked
- Everyone is gone
- Players are clutching the object from their dream
	- Its an amulet
- Trail of food, clothes and belongings lead off into the woods
- 300 ft into woods
	- Characters find symbol burned into nearby tree
	- As they approach, the symbol begins to glow, and their amulet grows hot
	- When they look, the symbol on the tree matches the one on the amulet
- BOOM!
	- Massive pulse of Divine energy ripples out
	- Reveals on old overgrown ruins

- The god tells the player that the gods have returned to aid the world, but need the assistance of the players and asks the character to become their herald 
- Shows player how to access the Rift bag (bestowed when the amulet unlocked the temple)
- Once the characters leave the temple, it vanishes as if it never existed
	- even the vegetation is returned to where it was before the pulse of energy
- When the players return to camp, everything is as it should be.
	- Nothing stolen
	- Nothing out of place
	- Entire group is sleeping soundly as if they were never gone. 
- But the character feels the new divine power flowing through them. 
	- The Gods have returned, and they have chosen to speak to you.
