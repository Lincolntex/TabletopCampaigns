## A) Pantheon of Krynn:

## B) Organizations:
![[OrdersKnightsMages.jpg]]
### 1) Mages of High Sorcery:
An organization of those with strong casting abilities divided into three different orders, each one dedicating themselves to the god of the Krynnian Moon their org is named after and governed by a council of experienced members known as the Counsel. Each order devoted to the study of magic and united in defending their knowledge and the order as a whole, they each differ in their use of magic. 
The counsel resides in the Tower of Wayreth, the last functioning tower of the 5 built by the Order thousands of years ago, which now functions as their headquarters and repository of all their greatest secretes. 

#### Test of High Sorcery
Anyone who wishes to join the order must pass this test. Each Mages test is unique to them, however, there are a few elements that are always present. 
- Lethal Failure
	- This test is designed to weed out those who would misuse magic. Failure always results in death. No judge, no jury, no score.
- Magical Acumen
	- A Mage must be competent in their use of magic. Each test is designed to push the Mage to their limit and sometimes further. 
- Test of Character
	- The Mage must always uphold the laws of the order, no matter the consequence. Mages will face moral and emotional challenges as well as magical ones.
- Illusion and reality
	- Friends, enemies and even loved ones may appear, and can have lasting consequences. The Mage will have no way of determining which challenges are real and which are an illusion. 
#### Order of the White Robes:
- Dedicated to the God Solinari
	- Healing and protection magic
- Use magic only for good
- Tries to walk the line of interfering in the affairs of others for the greater good
#### Order of the Red Robes
- Dedicated to the God Lunitari
	- Illusion and conjuration magic
	- depicted as a trickster god
- Use magic for self enrichment as they desire
- Expected to uphold the balance between good and evil
#### Order of the Black Robes
- Dedicated to the God Nutiari
	- Destruction and Dark Magic
- Study and use Black Magic to benefit the order
- Expected to first pursue their own ambitions, then the goals of their order, then those of the conclave
#### Renegades
If you are thrown out of the order, or leaves, the orgainization forbids them from continuing their practice of magic. Those who disregard this order are considered redegades, and are even hunted down by some of the members of the Order.

### 2) Knights of Solamnia:
[Build Guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csCd0eDeT5Y) 
Knights of Solamnia are an organization made up of 3 orders of Knights who have sworn to defend Krynn from the forces of Evil. Though once highly respected and very powerful, their forces and reputation have been severely tarnished over the years due to their close relationship with Istar and their failure to prevent the cataclysm. Though most knights still do try an uphold the old ways, a reputation of corruption, cowardice and bureaucracy now proceeds them. These days, Knights are locked in a better internal feud: Uphold the old code even in the face of obsolesce, or embrace the new world order to defend it, and risk changing the order of knights with it.  

#### Principals:
All three orders are bound to uphold a chivalric code made of two parts; the Oath, and the Measure.
- The Oath
	- Has been the same since KoS founding. 
	- "My Honor Is My Life"
		- All for the sake of Honor
		- Supposed to guide the actions of every knight regardless of order
- The Measure
	- Outlines the written laws, regulations and procedure of Knightly life and duties.
	- Its 37 volumes Includes everything from 
		- Laws governing Knights actions and behavior to
		- courtly etiquette and the proper saddling of mounts
	- Staggeringly complicated and excruciatingly specific
	- According to the Measure, KoS no longer have enough numbers to vote in a GrandMaster
		- Highest rank in KoS
		- Only authority who can overrule or update the Measure
		- This has caused conflict within KoS
			- Update the outdated document, limiting the strength of KoS?
			- Open themselves up to the rampant corruption within KoS?

#### Founding:
- Was founded over 1000 years ago
	- during the reign of Erothian Empire
- Ergoth Knight Vinas Solamnus was sent to put down a massive rebellion
- Solamnus listened to the people
	- Understood their grievances 
	- Lead rebellion march on the capital
		- Capital fell, Solamnus named King of Solamnia
- Solamnus wanted to lead with honor and justice
	- Sought guidance from Gods of good on Isle of Sancrist
	- Answered by 
		- Paladine: Order of the Rose
		- Kiri-Jolith: Order of the Sword
		- Habbakuk: Order of the Crown
	- The pillars or orders of KoS were formed with the guidance of these three gods
#### Order of the Crown:
- Dedicated to the God Habbakuk
	- Devoted to Loyalty and Obedience 
- First Order for new recruits
- Expected to aid any knight who requires assistance and any Kingdom on the KoS List of Loyalty
	- List of Loyalty: Official list of KoS allies
#### Order of the Sword
- Dedicated to the God Kiri-Jolith
	- Devoted to heroic honor, courage and reverence 
- Must undertake a heroic quest to prove their worth
- Expected to defend the defenseless without regard to knights personal suffering
#### Order of the Rose
- Dedicated to the God Paladine
	- Devoted to Wisdom tempered honor, and Justice 
- Knights must first rise within the rakes of the Crown and Sword, and have a Knight from each order vouch for you in order to join the Rose
- Expected to uphold the knights highest ideals, and held to the highest scrutiny
