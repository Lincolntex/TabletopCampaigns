## B) Organizations:
![[OrdersKnightsMages.jpg]]
### 1) Mages of High Sorcery:
An organization of those with strong casting abilities divided into three different orders, each one dedicating themselves to the god of the Krynnian Moon their org is named after and governed by a council of experienced members known as the Counsel. Each order devoted to the study of magic and united in defending their knowledge and the order as a whole, they each differ in their use of magic. 
The counsel resides in the Tower of Wayreth, the last functioning tower of the 5 built by the Order thousands of years ago, which now functions as their headquarters and repository of all their greatest secretes. 

#### Test of High Sorcery
Anyone who wishes to join the order must pass this test. Each Mages test is unique to them, however, there are a few elements that are always present. 
- Lethal Failure
	- This test is designed to weed out those who would misuse magic. Failure always results in death. No judge, no jury, no score.
- Magical Acumen
	- A Mage must be competent in their use of magic. Each test is designed to push the Mage to their limit and sometimes further. 
- Test of Character
	- The Mage must always uphold the laws of the order, no matter the consequence. Mages will face moral and emotional challenges as well as magical ones.
- Illusion and reality
	- Friends, enemies and even loved ones may appear, and can have lasting consequences. The Mage will have no way of determining which challenges are real and which are an illusion. 
#### Order of the White Robes:
- Dedicated to the God Solinari
	- Healing and protection magic
- Use magic only for good

#### Renegades
If you are thrown out of the order, or leaves, the orgainization forbids them from continuing their practice of magic. Those who disregard this order are considered redegades, and are even hunted down by some of the members of the Order.
