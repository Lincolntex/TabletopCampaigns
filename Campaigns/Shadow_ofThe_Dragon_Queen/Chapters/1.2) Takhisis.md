Takhisis the Dragon Queen, a multidimensional malicious deity also known as Tiamat, is the mother of all Chromatic Dragons, and seen as the most powerful of the evil Gods. She was banished from the world (Krynn) over a thousand years ago, but has been patiently plotting her return ever since. Now, 350 years after the cataclysm, the time has come for Takhisis to make her move and finally conquer the world of Krynn.

#### The Dragon Queens Return:
<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">DM NOTES (DO NOT READ ALOUD):</span>:
Unbeknownst to the other gods, Takhisis planted a piece of the shattered heart powering the Istarian Kingpriests ritual in the at Neraka, hidden in the volcanic Tama Busuk region, where it generated enough corrupt power to allow her influence to slip through via a portal. The crystal was incomplete however, preventing her from fully retuning to the world, so she had some of her Chromatic dragon followers to do her bidding. 

Under the orders of their God, Timats Dragons stole the eggos of good metallic dragons, forcing them to agree to to refrain from interfering in the coming war in exchange for their unborn children safety. 

But Tiamat had different plans for the metallic dragon eggs. She taught her followers how to corrupt these eggs, and transform the Dragonlings into monstrous warriors known as draconids, gambling that the new draconid armies would conquer Ansalon by the time the metallic dragons learned of the betrayal. Now, unhindered by Gods or Dragons, Takhisis unleashed her forces upon the world, and in their gods name, they began their conquest of Krynn. Organizations
