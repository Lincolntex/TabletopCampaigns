## Battle at High Hill
The Kingfisher festival culminutes in the annual reenactment of the battle at High Hill, about 30 min walk North of the village, but this time, the reenactment is serving a duel purpose. The mayor has hired Cudgels Ironclad Regiment to act as the Istarian forces as a kind of test to see how well the Vogler Militia holds up to stronger enemies. All does not go to plan...

#### To High Hill
- As players return from the docks
- The militia has formed a haphazard parade beginning to lead the way up to High Hill
- Parade has
	- Militia members
	- Villagers playing music and cheering
	- Carts selling food and drink for spectators. 
- Players will find Darrett and Becklin as the parade exits the front gates who ask to join
	- Characters can chat with these to and discover
		- reenacts the KoSolamnia ancient victory over Istar
			- Lead by Lord Vogler, Knight and founder of town.
			- Mayor arranged for cudgels regiment to play Istar
				- says it was a happy coincidence. 
				- Darrett thinks Mayor hired Regiment to test and strengthen the militia due to rumors of war
				- Plus, mercenaries on your side was a nice advantage
