Now that the Players have made a name for themselves in Kalaman, its time to start taking back land from the RDA. Use this section to show the growing might of the RDA forces. Now that the Players have made a name for themselves in Kalaman, can they live up to the expectations they have built? 

After the Players have met with the council, they spend the day doing as they please, and preparing. The following morning, Darrett meets the players in their chamber to discuss the recapture of the Wheelwatch Outpost.
## Wheelwatch Outpost

		- Tired of slow cautious progress, several council demanded Kalaman attack the smaller contingent
			- Encouraged by Bakaris Sr.

## Battle at Steel Springs
The trip to Steel Springs is uneventful. Players arrive at Steel Springs just as Kalamans forces are met with the full force of the RDA contingent. Kalaman council intel was way off. RDA detachment was twice the size they anticipated, and greatly out numbered Kalaman forces. Instead of supporting an attack, Players find themselves defending a slow retreat.
- When Players first see Steel Springs...
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 149, 0)">BOOK SDQ (pg. 93)</span>: "<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">As the brook called</span> the Inkwater comes into view..."
- Forces halt at the waterline of the North River, and throw Javelins at the fleeing Kalaman troops
- FIGHT! <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Roll for initiative</span>:
	- Battle Notes:
		- Goal is to successfully defend the retreating Kalaman troops from attacking RDA
		- Kalaman troops are injured
			- Each soldier only has 8 hp
			- Soldiers must move as a group, and can only move 15 ft (3 squares) each turn
			- When one group crosses the middle island, another emerges from the treeline
				- So does a new wave of RDA forces
			- There are 3 additional waves after the first
			- Combat is over when this final wave crosses the center island. 
		- Bakaris Sr is in Shock
			- Unable to move or act on his turn
