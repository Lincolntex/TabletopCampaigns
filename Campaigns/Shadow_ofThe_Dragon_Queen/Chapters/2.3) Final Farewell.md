## Ceremony
![[farewell_Ceremony.webp]] 
- The guests quicky gather on the dock around the party
	- Those closest to Ispin are able to gather on the dock overlooking the Vingarrd River
- Becklin, and Ironsmile take the stage next to a simple boat, within rests the body of Ispin Greenshield, wrapped in a shroud.
- A musician plays a soft melody as Becklin steps forward in her ornate Solamnic Knights armor and the ceremony begins.
	- She smiles gently at the crowd, and speaks, her voice carries clearly across the docks. 
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Becklin</span>: 
		- "You all knew Ispin as a friend, and ther were none like him. Before he died, he told me this, 'there should be tales, not tears, for and old scoundrel like me. Make sure everyone knows my stories when I head off on the greatest adventure of them all.'"
			- Becklin nods, and with the help of Ironsmile, lower the small boat containing Ispin down into the river.
		- "So, lets do just that,"
			- Becklin continues as the little boat begins to drift down river
		- "On the eve of the Kingfisher Festival, we celebrate you, Ispin. Good travels, friend. Until we meet again."
	- The crowd remains still as the small boat drifts further down the river and eventually, out of sight
	- After a moment of silence, Becklin invites everyone back into the Inn for the reception and to share grand stories of Ipsin
- Reception
	- [[Inn Keep Yalme]] keeps food and ale flowing
	- Simple, but crowded
		- Players can find anyone of the people they previously met in the village
	- Soon after reception begins
	- Becklin calls for everyones attention
		- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Becklin</span>:
			- "In honor of Ispin, I'd like to share one of his favorite stories. Everyone, top off their beer and have a seat."
			- She gives everyone a few minutes to find their seats
			- "Ispin was on one of his adventures, this time to Mount Nevermind, home of the Tinker Gnomes. If I remember right, I think he said he was helping the Senior Artillerist gather the components she needed for her new invention. A Gnomeflinger they called it; absolutely crazy contraption. We have one mounted on the roof of the Keep actually. Anyway, during her final tests, she launched her pet weasel to the other side of Sancrist Island, then had Ispin go recover the poor little creature or at least note its trajectory! Ispin said he saw the poor critter get launched clear over the mountain, but never gave up on the little guy. He swears he waited at an Inn off the main road on the other side of the mountain closest to the peak, and sure enough found the little bugger on his way up the hill late one evening, not even too worse for ware!"
			- Crowd laughs
		- Becklin will ask if anyone else had any fond memories or stories of Ispin anyone would like to share. 
		- [[Uncle Elthar]] <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">will stand up</span> out of his chair.
			- "Aye, I spose' I have a fishin tale of our ol Ispin"
				- The adults of the room look around and roll their eyes, but the children are fixed on Uncle.
			- First time Uncle remembers seeing Benebog the Linebreaker
				- Fishing up river close to Kalaman
					- still river, but water is deep on the edge of the sea
						- anything's libel to pop up there
				- About to pack up and move on when
				- Large shadow passes beneath them
				- CRACK! SCREAM!
					- Something hit a small boat
					- Boat is sinking
					- two boys on the boat cry for help
					- Uncle tosses rope a few times
					- boys wont even try to reach out into the water
				- Right then, something hits Ispins line
					- almost took him off his feet
				- The jolt snapped the older boy out of it
					- Grabbed the rope
					- Began to pull sinking boat closer
				- Ispins line when slack
					- Benebog launches out of water
						- Big armored catfish
						- 10-15 feet long
				- Kids over, but boat too small
				- Only option, Cut the line
				- Ispin cuts line
					- Looses fish, saves lives
				- He spent several years looking for Benebog, but lost some part of his desire to find the fish again that day. 
			- Wishes luck to all the fishermen entering the contest tomorrow, and that maybe someone will finally catch ol Benebog the Linebreaker 
			- "Yeah, Me!" an anonymous voice calls out from the crowd, but is quicky hushed and silenced by his neighbors. 
		- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Becklin</span> quickly speaks up:
			- "We'll just have to wait and see! Thank you, Uncle. We all love your fishermans tales. You know, I think Benebog grows another few feet every time you tell that story."
				- The crowd laughs and Uncle raises his mug
			- "But I jest. I personally have never seen Benebog, so who am I to say."
		- Becklin looks toward the crowd, and asks if anyone else would like to share any stories about Ispin. 
		- Players are encouraged to tell a story, or roll from the Ispin's Stories table. 
			- If they tell a story, they get a DM [inspiration](https://dnd5e.info/beyond-1st-level/inspiration/). 
	- After a few stories are told, [[Bakaris Jr. Uth Estide]] begins heckling the story tellers.
		- "Come On! We've heard this one 1000 times already!"
		- Always in a sarcastic disrespectful tone
		- "Boo! You're telling it worse than he did!"
		- Bakaris cares nothing for Ispin 
			- Only there for the free ale
				- Which he says is the worst he's ever tasted. 
			- Is sitting with his feet kicked up on the table Infront of him 
		- Everyone grumbles, but no one directly confronts Bakaris
