#### Rules:
- Slot based rules (no weight)
	- Weightless gold/currency
	- Item weight is null
		- Item has a slot cost (SC) - volume size in sq ft
		- ex: 1 potion: SC = 1, 1 sword: SC = 3
	- Player Bags have a max slot limit (MS) that a bag can hold
		- Once MS has been hit, nothing else can be put into the bag
		- Players can have multiple bags, but its up to the DM on how many they can carry based on the size of additional bags, and the player strength 
	- Rift Bag:
		- A Divine power bestowed upon the gods chosen
		- Gods bestowed Players with a divine rift for shared storage via the Rift Bag
		- All Players have access to Rift Bag from their Player Bags
		- Each Rift Bag slot stacks like items, and has an infinite MS 
			- can store any one type of item, regardless of SC
		- Great for high SC cost items, or for regularly shared items (like potions!)
