## Overview:

This adventure begins in the village of [[Villane]], a small hamlet in the backwater of the kingdom. It's a quiet place... most of the time. The Player Characters are all friends from a nearby village, traveling to Bedegar, in search of adventure. Recently, there has been an in influx of goblins in the region and some of the foul creatures have even begun attacking the farms in the outskirts of the village. It isn't long before they find themselves mixed up in the business of Goblins, pursuing the daughter of the Blacksmith into the depths of a long forgotten tomb. This is their opportunity to prove themselves, and to rescue someone in need, if they can survive the perils of the Delian Tomb!

## Introduction:

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">The party finds themselves in the back of an ox-cart, traveling to the city of Bedegar, in search of new opportunities. The party members are all old friends from the same nearby village, and have decided to travel together. Recently, there has been an in influx of goblins in the region and some of the foul creatures have even begun attacking the farms and homes in the outskirts of the nearby villages.</span>

#### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Player Intro!</span> 

<span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Now would be a great time for you ask the Players to describe their Characters. It's good for everyone to get an idea of who they are and who their party is made up of, it will help you all get a bit more immersed in the story.</span>

## Part 1: Green Dragon Inn

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">The party has been traveling by cart for most of the day. Its early evening, about an hour or two before sunset, as you hear the driver call out in a tired voice and let you know that Villane, the final stop, was just ahead.

As the cart arrives and stops in front of the stables at the south entrance of the Hamlet, everyone climbs out of the back of the cart and takes a look around. The Hamlet is formed by a small horseshoe of buildings surrounding a stockade and a hangman's noose. You notice a few of the locals glancing curiously in your direction and begin to whisper amongst themselves.
</span>
### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Passive Perception Check!</span>
- **<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Passive perception = 10 + (Wisdom Modifier)</span>
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">DC: 10</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">You hear the villagers refer to you as Ratcatchers, who may be willing to help them solve their more dangerous problems, given the right incentive.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Dusk Falls, as the party approaches the building closest to the ranch house, the local Tavern called</span> [[The Green Dragon Inn]]. <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">A few travelers could been seen hovering around the establishment for food, warmth, and a place to rest. A handful of villagers are here, eating, drinking and talking about their day as the party enters the Inn and sits down at an open table. One day is much the same as another in the hamlet of Villane, however, from the looks of the new adventurers, these villagers started to suspect that today may be different.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">A young boy who was chatting with a few of the patrons while absent mindedly cleaning, quickly tosses his rag over his shoulder and scampers up to the party’s table.</span>

- [[Matt Hearthwood]]
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">"Hello, and welcome to the Green Dragon Inn! My family runs this Tavern! My name is Matt. Can I get you anything to eat or drink? My mom makes an amazing chicken pot pie!"</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">"Where are you guys from?"</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">"We don’t see very many Ratcatchers coming through Vilane these days."</span>

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">This is your opportunity to help the players get immersed in the world, feel free to let the players get to know Matt and ask questions! Take a moment to describe what he looks like, how he moves, and how he responds to player questions. While Matt is off fixing whatever has been ordered, and the players have had a chance to get to know each other and the NPCs, The next scene begins...</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Suddenly, a large man bursts through the front door. The imposing smell of sulfur permeates the man who is wearing a black leather apron over his linen shirt and woolen pants. You also notice a large hammer hanging by his belt as he exclaims,</span>

- [[Lars McGowan]]:

	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">"The Goblins… They got Bess… They got my girl!"</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">The Barkeep (Joshua) slowly approaches, the man and tries to calm the blacksmith down</span>.

- [[Joshua Hearthwood]]:

	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">"Easy now, Lars. Catch your breath and tell us what happened."</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">He brings a mug over to Lars, which is mostly ignored as Lars fumbles over his words trying to tell his story as quickly as possible,</span>

- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Lars:</span>

	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">"I was cleaning up after working the forge all day, and that’s when I heard Bess screaming from the garden out front by the cottage. I ran out to see what was going on when I saw five or six Goblins throwing my little Bess into a large burlap sack. I ran out waving my hammer over my head trying to scare them off. A few of them turned their attention to me and started poking at me with their swords. They backed me into a corner, but I lashed out with my hammer and managed to land a blow to the side of one of the goblins head. The few that were fighting me ran off, but still bought their comrades the time they needed to escape with Bess. That’s when I ran all the way here to find anyone willing to help me go rescue Bess!"</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">You look around and can tell Lars is well liked judging from the sympathetic looks coming from the Green Dragon patrons, however, no one stands up or offers any aid. Once Lars finished his story, the rest of the crowd looks away, keeping their heads low, not wanting to draw attention to themselves.</span>

- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Joshua:</span>

	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">"I feel terrible about what happened to Bess, Lars, truly, but you know we are not equipped to handle an entire band of Goblins right now. We would be walking into a massacre. Quick! Lets go rally the neighbor’s and gather a hunting party...”</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Lars cuts Joshua off telling him that would take way too long, and that he didn't want to imagine what the goblins would have done to Bess by then. Its at this point Lars notices the adventuring party and begins scrambling his way over to the parties table, who he recognizes as Ratcatchers.</span>

- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Lars:</span>

	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">“You! You’re Ratcatchers, right!? Not scared of a fight? Please help me save my Bess. I can pay, and I know the Duke has a standing bounty for every goblin ear collected. Please save my only Daughter!”</span>

	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Lars doesn’t know where the Goblins went with his daughter but is sure they can be tracked. He will urge the players back to his house to investigate.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Once players have agreed to follow Lars back to his forge, you may continue to part 2.</span>

## Part 2: Goblin Chase

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Lars leads the way out of the Green Dragon Tavern up the road North of Vilane to his forge. As you walk through the Hamlet, you get a better look at the buildings lining the road. You take note of each of town layout as you walk by. The stables and ranch house are the first buildings in Villane by the Southern entrance. The Green Dragon Inn is the first building in the row of building lining the East side of Villane. The next building appears to be a small community storehouse, wedged between the Inn and a little shop with a small sign reading "Turner's General Goods".</span>

- [[Villane Church of The Light]]
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">The church is empty. Father corwin will be in the office until he hears someone enter the church. He will then go greet the guest and ask if they are in need</span>

- [[Community Storehouse]]
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">The old building is locked up tight. There are no windows, and the only entrance is a big sliding door with a large chain keeping it shut tight</span>

- [[Turner’s General Goods]]
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Bill Turner will just nod in their direction and answer their questions as briefly as possible</span>


<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">You leave the hamlet and begin walking down the Northern road leading to the forge. The road winds through the countryside of plains and small rolling hills. Other than the occasional solitary Oak growing by the side of the road, few other trees can be seen past the edge of the looming forest in the distance, growing closer with each step. Lars has been leading the band of adventures as quickly as he can. Even with the relatively quick pace, it takes about an hour and a half to make it to the forge, which is just on the edge of the large forest.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">As soon as you arrive at the forge, you can easily see the mess caused by the goblins. The fence has been torn down in several sections, and the garden has been completely destroyed.</span>

- [[Lars McGowan]] <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">gestures to the scene before you and exclaims:</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">"See! This is where the Goblins attacked! They retreated off into the Boar Woods, but I can't find anything specific showing us where they took Bess."</span>

### <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Survival Check!</span>
- <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">Roll for Wisdom (DC: 10)</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">There was an obvious scuffle, and the tracks scattered everywhere around the forge are easy to spot. After closer examination you can see that at least two goblins dragged something north into the large forest.</span>

- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">Lars:</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Under his breath</span>
		- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">“Were coming for you, Bess.”</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">You begin to follow the trail left by the goblins into the woods. After following the goblin trail for a few minutes Lars begins to quietly explain how the Boar Wood was used as a hunting ground by the locals, but most people don’t stay around past nightfall due to recent dangers in the area.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">Lars feels a visible shudder snake its way down his spine after that last statement. Weather it was caused by the chilly evening air, or the thought of some strange creature stalking coming up from the woods looking for a quick meal that just passed through his mind, he really wasn’t sure.</span>
<span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">After tracking the Goblins trail for 10 or 15 minutes, night begins to fall over the forest and it becomes too dark to follow the tracks any further. You find a small clearing in the woods  just large enough to set up a small camp.</span> <span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">The tracks run right through the clearing making them easy to find again.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Give the party a chance to suggest making camp and let them go through the motions if they desire. Once camp has been set up, ask the players who wants to take the first watch.</span>

		- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">You hear a rustling in the bushes on the other side of the camp. You wait patiently as you see a boar poke its head out through the bushes and begin to look around the campsite. He doesn’t appear to have noticed you yet.</span>
		- <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">If the player makes a move:</span>

You continue making your way through the forest, winding your way down a path leading around large old trees covered in moss and through the  damp vegetation blanketing the ground. Other than the occasional curious boar, you are able to continue following the goblins without interruption. After following the trail for about an hour, you reach the edge of the Boar Woods. Once the group reaches the tree line and have a better view of your surroundings, you see the forest give way to a vast valley with gently rolling hills that appears to go on for miles. </span><span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">
As your eyes follow the Northern movement of the goblins, you can barley make out what looks like the carved stone of an entrance to an ancient ruin tucked away behind a hill a few hundred yards away, the perfect place for a roaming band of goblins to hold up...</span>

- <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">PUZZLE!</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 123, 0)">At the base of the statue of Delius there is an inscription that reads:</span>
		- <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 80)">"If you are to keep these treasures, first bestow them unto me"</span>
	- <span style="color:rgb(255, 123, 0)">below the inscription fixed to the stone is an empty brass bowl. </span> 
		- <span style="color:rgb(255, 255, 0)">If enough treasure is placed in the bowl, a secret door will slide open in the back Left corner of the room leading to a secret chamber through short hallway</span> 

## Secret Room:

<span style="color:rgb(255, 123, 0)">The chamber is lined with sarcophagi, 3 on each side with a 7th larger one at the back of the room. There are a few more healing potions scattered around the room and a journal resting on the large sarcophagus detailing the origin of the Delian order and their purpose</span>

<span style="color:rgb(255, 0, 0)">Long ago when the Caelian empire ruled, a knight by the name of Delius founded the Delian Order and together they devoted their lives to the fight against Maglubiyet, the goblin god of war. These ruins are the Orders final resting place.</span>

<span style="color:rgb(255, 123, 0)">If any character attempts to open a sarcophagi, they will disturb the spirits of the Delian Order. Righteous skeletons will emerge from the sarcophagi, eager to expel the desecrators from their tomb. One exception being, in the event that the character who attempts to open a sarcophagi is a Paladin who has sworn the Delian Oath, for they are a member of the Delian Order. The treasures are theirs by holy right! </span>
