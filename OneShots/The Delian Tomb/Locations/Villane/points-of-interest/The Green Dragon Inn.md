Owned and operated by the Hearthwood family, the Green Dragon Inn is a quaint little tavern in the Villane hamlet. It has a simple rustic feel, with round dining tables in the center of the tavern with booths surrounding the North, and East walls. The bar runs along the South wall and has a small kitchen tucked away behind the bar. The 5 rooms available for rent can be found up the stairs by the entryway to the tavern.
